        <h2>New Bay and Bow Replacement Windows</h2>
        <p>
          Boost your home’s curb appeal with new bay or bow windows. These
          window options add a stunning aesthetic and natural light to any
          space. A bay window protrudes from the outer wall of your home and is
          made of three individual window units that come together at equal
          angles. A bow window extends from a home’s structure and typically
          includes four to six panes alongside each other. This design gives a
          bow window a smooth, curved appearance.

        <h2>What is the difference between Bay and Bow Windows?</h2>
        <strong>Bow windows are similar to bay windows with the difference being
          that:
        </strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Bay Windows has fewer panes, usually a larger picture window in the
            center, with two smaller windows on either side
          </li>
          <li>
            Bay Windows have a more angular, boxier appearance and fewer panes
            than bow windows. Bow windows have a more graceful curve associated
            with their look.
          </li>

          <li>
            Bow windows are an excellent option for adding charm, character, and
            curb appeal. While they can add natural light and brightness to any
            room, they also provide additional space that can be used for
            seating, storage and more
          </li>
