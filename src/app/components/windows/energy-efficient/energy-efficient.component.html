        <h2>Lower Your Utility Costs with New Replacement Windows</h2>
        <p>
          If you are like most homeowners in the Chicagoland area, you probably
          do not realize how much money gets wasted each month due to
          inefficient windows, especially if your windows are older than 10
          years. Replacing them with a more energy-efficient option is an
          effective way to help minimize spending on energy expenses.
