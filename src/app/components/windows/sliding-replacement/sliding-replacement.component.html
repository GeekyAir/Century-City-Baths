        <h2>New Sliding Replacement Windows
        </h2>
        <p>When considering replacement windows for your home, slider windows offer many advantages over traditional
          options. Sliding windows, often called slider windows, have one sash on each side that slides in either
          direction rather than up and down. They are comprised of two panes of framed glass that are situated parallel
          to each other. </p>
        <br>
        <h2>What are the Advantages of Slider Windows?</h2>
        <p>While slider windows were once only available to fit small spaces, you can now custom-design your windows to
          fit your design needs, for example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Brightening a small space over the kitchen sink</li>
          <li>Complimenting bay windows</li>
          <li>Bringing in more natural light with door sized sliders.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Other Benefits Include:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> <strong>Low maintenance: </strong> these windows are easy to clean and can be removed from their tracks
            to allow for
            thorough cleaning of the inside and outside surfaces</li>
          <li> <strong>Ease of operation: </strong> sliding effortlessly horizontally on their tracks eliminates the
            need to lift heavy, traditional windows.</li>
          <li><strong>Minimal maintenance: </strong> sliding windows have fewer parts than conventional windows, meaning
            less chance of
            breaking vital parts that control operation.</li>
          <li><strong>Energy efficiency:</strong> you can add special coatings to increase insulation and reduce energy
            bills.</li>
        </ul>
